<h1 align="center">Convex Optimization Reading Group, May-July 2017</h1>

<h2 align="center">Every Wednesday 11:30hrs-13:00hrs, Room No: , Academic Block A.</h2>

The aim of this reading group is to learn the subject "Convex Optimization" through discussions. All interested students can join this and if interested can also lead the discussion of his interest.
The topics for discussion comes from <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf">Convex Optimization</a> book by Boyd and Vandenberghe, and also from a previous course offered by Ryan Tibshirani at CMU <a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/convexopt/">Convex Optimization: Fall 2016.</a>
<br>
We intend to meet once in a week (Twice if there exist sufficient interest). The topics are tentative now and can be changed to suit the mutual interest of all students.
